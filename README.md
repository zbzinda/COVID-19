# COVID-19
This repository contains high level info on how to create the necessary CSV files to make a basic COVID-19 dashboard with data from Johns Hopkins and the Twitter API. This does require having an API key from Twitter which requires creating a developer account if you haven't done so previously. I've included PDFs of the reports that can be created and pinned to a dashboard, but if you have a Power BI account and would like access to the full dashboard or want to interact with any of the reports send me an email at zind0015@umn.edu and I'd be happy to share.
